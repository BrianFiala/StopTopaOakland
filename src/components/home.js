Background:
In the next few weeks the Oakland City Council has announced its intention to introduce the:

Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act or “TOPA” 

Its sponsors claim TOPA will decrease homelessness, eliminate gentrification, and increase ownership opportunities for tenants. But this is far from the truth

TOPA has been in the works behind the scenes for years. And upon reading the details of the ordinance, it becomes clear that this legislation will not help underprivileged tenants or prevent homelessness. It does not aim to increase our housing stock or provide real homeownership opportunities for renters who want to own.  

Its sponsors are using our underprivileged as a front to take control over private property by granting the city the power to dictate how it can be sold, to who it can be sold, and even how much it can be sold for.

TOPA is Eminent Domain in disguise
This is the most aggressive assault on private property rights to date. It will have devastating effects on owners, tenants, and the future of our city. All while solely benefiting outside special interest groups, lawyers, and complicit politicians.

Modeled on the failed Washington DC “TOPA” model,  and on the heels of a non-partisan rejection by outraged Richmond residents late last year- the soon to be presented Oakland bill is expected to mimic the Richmond and Berkeley TOPA documents found below: 

Review the Richmond TOPA and newly introduced Berkeley TOPA ordinances here.






Breakdown of what to expect in Oakland based on Berkeley’s proposed TOPA :
Most all privately owned rental housing is affected by this legislation, including the renting of your own home

•First right of refusal: TOPA demands you offer your property to your tenants or tenants group before it is placed on the market. Consequently, this prevents your property from going on the market for sale until every renter waives his or her rights in writing. This will create lengthy, unpredictable time periods frustrating a sale and perverse incentives.

In addition to offering all tenants in the building first right of refusal, each owner will also need to inform  each and every listed “non-profit” developer approved by the city of the owner’s intent to sell.

•Allows tenants to transfer these rights to a third party “non-profit” developer . In Washington DC this resulted in property owners being extorted by tenants groups and non profits alike.

•Allows for the sales price of the property offered to tenant(s) or third party be set by the City through a "city trained" appraiser. It allows for the tenant to challenge your offer to them, by activating a "city-approved" and trained appraiser who will assess the price of your sale. That price will then become the price you must offer to your tenant or the nonprofit.

Any tenant or tenant group who purchases a property through these regulations would have to pass over its control to the city through a deed restriction. The city would then limit and govern allowable future sales price, tenancy requirements, and allowable rent levels indefinitely. The new owner would be on the hook for all the financial and physical costs of maintaining the property with virtually non of the upside. This is not a worthwhile ownership opportunity for tenants.

Any owner found in violation of these TOPA regulations could be fined $1,000/per day/per unit

TOPA would hurt owners and tenants alike
Renters: If you succeed in qualifying- does buying a property that the city controls amount to a worthwhile investment to you? Once the city converts the title to be “permanently affordable”, what is that property then worth?  It would essentially remove all the financial benefits of ownership (appreciation, income, tenancy control), and leave you with all the financial responsibilities. If you have goals of owning in the future, would you want your hard earned investment to be subject to these restrictions?

Owners aware of the risks associated with these regulations  will choose to pull their rental units from the market rather than exposing their property to TOPA. The rental stock will decrease further, exacerbating our housing shortage, and increasing demand and subsequently rents for those units that are available. 

Homeowners/property owners: How would you feel if the sale price of your house or income property was dictated by a “city trained” appraiser? What if you need to sell your property quickly due to illness or a financial emergency, or have counted on renting your property as your sole source of retirement income? How could you effectively navigate through the myriad of bureaucratic requirements? Your sale could be held up indefinitely under these regulations, with the value of your home or retirement investment being dictated by the city.

So who looks to actually benefit from this ordinance? It’s special interests groups, “Non-profit” third parties and assisted housing developers that can have the tenant’s rights transferred to them, leverage them against the owner, and acquire your property at a steep discount. It’s the lawyers who will have a field day with the 31 page set of laws, sales requirements, and “gotchas”. And it’s the politicians who have failed to come up with real solutions for our housing shortage, and have instead decided to sell out their own private property owning constituency for fabricated political posterity.

This is a brazen attempt to seize private property through a coercive set of regulations. Instead of creating more housing, the city wants to take it from the small private owners.

Everyone who cares about our city should be against this.

We can not let this action by the city council fly under the radar. 

What you can do to help STOP TOPA
Contact the Council and demand they Stop TOPA:
Inform them that you have investigated this and understand the perverse consequences.

That you know there is no legitimate reason to do such a thing to homeowners and tenants.
Tell them you will see TOPA next to their names when you vote next time.

AND VOTE THEM OUT!
